    /// and every item in the Workspace menu but one points at a directory that is not there.

    /// while you read one. What narrows is the centre column, which shows that agent's own
    /// conversation instead of the workspace's tabs.

    /// `rememberSelection` therefore stores the parent, which is what should reopen. That is a
    /// weaker claim here than it is for `.subagent`, whose row cannot survive a relaunch at all,

    /// `selectedWorkspace != nil`, so clicking a session inside a workspace put the changed files
    /// away, hid the toolbar's Inspector button and greyed the Workspace menu, although nothing
    /// about the worktree had changed. The pane then grew a second, poorer changes column of its
    /// own to stand in, so one workspace had two right hand columns depending on which of its rows
    /// was clicked.
