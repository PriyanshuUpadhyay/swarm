///
/// # Why a scheme of its own, and not `file://`
///
/// The browser pane opens a page out of the worktree with `loadFileURL`, and a preview could have
/// done the same for HTML. It does not, for three reasons measured against what agents write.
/// A `file://` page has an opaque origin, so a report that `fetch`es the JSON beside it, or loads
/// its script as a module, fails where it would work from any server. Markdown has no file to
/// load at all, only a string, and a string loaded with a `file://` base gets no read access to
/// the images next to it. And `loadFileURL` grants a whole directory to WebKit, which is then
/// WebKit's to police.
///
/// So every request a preview makes arrives at Swarm as `swarm-preview://worktree/<path>`, and
/// `file(for:root:)` below is the one place that turns an address back into a path. Anything that
/// does not resolve inside the root, symlinks included, is refused there, which is the containment
/// `LocalPage.fileURL` gives the browser, applied per request rather than per directory.
