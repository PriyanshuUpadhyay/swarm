///
/// The two roles that may call it differ in two ways, and both follow from one fact: a workspace
/// agent is in a workspace and the owner's client is not. They used to differ in a third, which
/// was that only a workspace agent's calls were deduplicated, and that one was a gap rather than a
/// distinction.
///
/// A workspace agent may leave the project out, and then the new workspace goes in the project it
/// is already in. It may also name one, which is how work is handed from one repository to
/// another: an agent in the site's project that finds the fix belongs in the app starts it there.
/// The owner's client must name a project, because nothing else says which. Either way the name is
/// resolved by `BridgeProjectLookup`, so both may only name a project Swarm already has and both
/// are refused in the same words when the name matches nothing or matches too much.
///
/// Naming another project changes nothing else about the call. The workspace is still `.agent`
/// origin with the caller as its parent, so the running ceiling counts it, the parent may rename
/// and archive it, and it may not start more. Every one of those is keyed on the parent's
/// workspace id and none on its repository, which is what lets the child live somewhere else.
///
/// A workspace agent's workspaces are `.agent` origin and carry its id; the owner's are `.ownerClient`
/// origin and carry no parent. How many either may start is not decided here: `WorkspaceOrigin`
/// answers it through `WorkspaceStartAllowance`, which holds all three answers, the sheet's
/// included, in one switch.
///
/// Both roles are deduplicated by a digest of the call, because a model retries and a retried
/// spawn cuts a second worktree. The owner's used to be exempt on the grounds that `.user` had
/// nowhere to record the key, which was true of `.user` and is the reason `.ownerClient` exists.

            Start a workspace and give it a task. It is a real git worktree on its own branch with \
            its own agent, and it appears in Swarm's sidebar for the owner to watch and review.

            Name the project to start it in with 'project', giving the name or the path that \
            project_list reports. Swarm only starts workspaces in repositories it already has, so \
            a project that is not on that list has to be registered with project_add first, which \
            only the owner can do. If you are \
            yourself running inside a Swarm workspace, leave 'project' out to start it in the \
            project you are already in, or name another project to hand the work to that \
            repository instead. The new workspace is still counted as one you started.

            Use it when a task splits into parts that do not need to see each other's edits, and \
            you want them worked on at the same time rather than one after another.

            There are two ways to start it, the two Swarm's own create window offers, and picking \
            the wrong one is the mistake worth avoiding here.

            '\(WorkspaceSourceTab.newBranch.title)' is the default and needs nothing said. \
            \(WorkspaceSourceTab.newBranch.explanation) Name the branch to cut from with \
            'base_branch', or leave it out for the project's default branch.

            '\(WorkspaceSourceTab.existingBranch.title)' is 'existing_branch'. \
            \(WorkspaceSourceTab.existingBranch.explanation) Use it to carry on, review or fix \
            work that is already on a branch: cutting a new branch off that branch instead gives \
            you a workspace whose diff is empty, because it starts out identical to the branch \
            you named. The branch has to exist already, and git allows one worktree per branch, \
            so a branch another workspace is sitting on is refused rather than opened twice.

            To review an existing GitHub pull request, use 'pull_request' with its number, '#123', \
            or its GitHub URL. Swarm checks out the pull request itself, preserving its base and \
            identity so the Changes, Checks and Merge controls refer to that pull request. Do not \
            create a review branch with base_branch for this purpose.

            Name only one of base_branch, existing_branch or pull_request.

            It returns as soon as the workspace exists, not when its work is done. The new agent \
            starts on its own and keeps running while you carry on. There is no way to wait for \
            it from here, so do not ask for one and then sit idle: say what you started and get on \
            with your own work.

            Pass notify_when_done: true to have Swarm tell this chat once, by itself, when the new \
            agent's first turn comes to rest: finished (with its last message), failed (with the \
            reason), or blocked waiting on the owner for a permission prompt or a question. With \
            it, there is no need to tell the new agent to report back when it is done.

            The task you give it is all it gets. It cannot see this conversation, so write the \
            prompt as if to someone who has just opened the project for the first time.

            This costs real money and real disk. Start one because the work genuinely divides, \
            not to parallelise something you could do in a single pass. A workspace that was \
            itself started this way cannot start others.
